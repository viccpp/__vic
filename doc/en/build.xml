<p>To build the library you need one of supported C++ compilers and
<link href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make">GNU Make</link> utility version
3.82 or higher available in your command line environment (shell).</p>

<p>Currently supported compilers are:</p>
<list style="bulleted">
    <item>GNU C++ v 4.7+ [<tt>gcc</tt>]</item>
    <item>Clang v 3.4+ [<tt>clang</tt>]</item>
</list>

<p>Go to <tt>src</tt> subdirectory and write:</p>
<tty>
$ gmake
</tty>
<p>The library file will be built for you.</p>

<p>C++14 is used by default but you can choose another language standard
version using <tt>std</tt> option. E.g. to build the library in C++98 mode
write:</p>
<tty>
$ gmake std=98
</tty>

<p>Available values include: 98, 11, 14, 17, 20 and 23.</p>

<p>Also you can choose the used compiler manually:</p>
<tty>
$ gmake compiler=gcc
</tty>

<p>Finally, to use the library you just need to copy the library file and
contents of <tt>include</tt> subdirectory to some place where compiler/linker
can find it, e.g to <tt>/usr/local/include</tt> and <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt>.</p>
